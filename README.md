# custom-chess-cli
Play chess using only text in a bespoke command line interface. Built using [Game CLI](https://github.com/ethpalser/game-cli).

## Purpose
Custom Chess CLI is built to play Chess in a minimal environment and test Custom Chess. The CLI itself is not intended to be an accessible way to configure and setup custom pieces and games, but should be suitable for simple changes and robust enough for making changes. This will save and load from files, and as a result will allow using custom board and custom piece definitions used by Custom Piece API and Custom Piece Web.
